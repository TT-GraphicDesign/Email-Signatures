This Repository Stores the HTML code for Trendy Treats staff email signatures. 

Updated: January 16th, 2024 

All Image elements are sourced from Imgur.com, under the account TTGraphicDesign (accessible by using em@trendytreats.com email), and can be changed if need be. 
Preferrable image host is Google Drive, but the link is not working as of Jan. 16th, 2024, and when it does start working please change it to Google, since Trendy Treats utilized the G Suite for emails. 

The way this Repository is set up is that each branch corresponds to a different staff email signature, with the 'main' branch as it's template. If updating the email signatures at any moment, make sure to update the 'main' index.html before proceeding to change the other branches.
